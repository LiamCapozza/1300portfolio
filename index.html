      <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <div class="fonda-intro">
        <p>
          This project was a collaboration with fellow Brown students to work
          with a startup called Mi Fonda. They are a restaurant banking system
          that allows for streamlined income and expenses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They tasked us with creating an app for their clients, which would be
          a complete overhaul when compared to their website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Throughout the project we had lots of back and forth emails with the
          CTO of Mi Fonda. This was a valuable experience with corporate
          communication and adapting to the needs of a userbase
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Starting Out</h2>
      <div class="given-info">
        <img class="given-website" src="fonda-desktop.png" />
        <p>
          This is the Fonda current website and they do not have an app. Our
          project group was tasked with creating an app to display the
          information on the go, with a new, more modern look
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Sketching My Ideas</h2>

      <div class="fonda-sketches">
        <p>
          My first flow incorporated more elements from their original site
          while my second flow felt more like an app.

          <br />
          <br />

          During my sketches, it became apparent to me that the second flow felt
          right and was better for seeing and understanding information quickly
          and on the go. It applied more mobile practices and was the flow I
          ultimately pulled the most from throughout the project.
        </p>
        <img class="liams-sketches" src="liamsketches.png" />
      </div>
      <h2>Collaborating and Wireframing</h2>

      <div class="fonda-wireframes">
        <img class="wireframes" src="wireframes.png" />
        <p>
          We had a basic login screen that was up to par with one’s found on
          many types of apps. We wanted to keep things simple and modern. The
          dashboard is supposed to be an “at a glance” view of the account. It
          displays the balance as well as a donut graph to show different
          expenses.
          <br />
          <br />

          We knew we wanted to display both the revenue and expenses and decided
          later on to use a bar graph. Finally, our account info screen had
          space for us to add multiple different buttons in three categories,
          Personal, Security, and Other.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <div class="fonda-high">
        <p>
          Throughout the design we used the Roboto font which aligned with the
          style guide given to us by Fonda. We utilized the different heading
          and body text sizes to emphasize more important points, such as the
          balance on the dashboard or the day of the week in transactions.
          <br />
          <br />
          We also made sure to change our design to emphasize contrast of
          colors, since part of our feedback was changing the transactions to
          have a light background instead of dark.
        </p>

      </div>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="fonda-conclusion">
        <p>
          Working on this app with Mi Fonda was a great first experience in
          startup companies. We got to improve our design skills and learn how
          to adjust our work to meet real business needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          It was very important to adapt and improve, which was challenging but
          rewarding. This project was a solid crash course in navigating client
          needs and delivering a product that makes a difference.

      <h1>Personas</h1>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <div class="persona-intro">
        <p>
          This case study focuses on selecting a physical interface in the real
          world and creating personas based upon research and interviews
          conducted. I chose the Coca Cola FreeStyle machine that can be found
          in restaurants all across the country.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Chosen Interface</h2>
      <div class="persona-choice">
        <img class="real-freestyle-machine" src="coke-machine.jpeg" />
        <p>
          I decided on the freestyle machine due to its abudnace on campus here
          and since everyone uses it when visiting the dining hall. Its relative
          simplicity made it a good target for user research.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>FreeStyle Machine Breakdown</h2>
      <div class="persona-sketch">
        <p>
          The Freestyle machine has a single spout that can dispense hundreds of
          drink options.
          <br />
          <br />
          Choose a base drink and add any flavor, press the dispense button, and
          a custom drink pours out from the spout.

      <h2>Interviewing Students</h2>

      <div class="persona-interviews">
        <p>
          I wanted to see what students had to say about this machine. Each of
          the following were observed during their use and approached afterwards
          to answer some questions. These were the takeaways from each
          discussion.
        </p>

        <div class="person 1">
          <h3>Person 1</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Observations:</strong> Approached the machine quickly. Had
            to hit the 'back' button multiple times. Chose Barq’s Root Beer Zero
            with no flavors. Made decisions quickly and used the ice dispenser.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Interview Insights:</strong> Found the process very clear
            and user-friendly, even for first-timers. Uses the machine
            regularly, likes the organized flavor options, never used the QR
            code, enjoys seasonal drinks.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Likes a quick and efficient interaction,
            with minor issues on responsiveness.

          <h3>Person 2</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Observations:</strong> Waited in line, chose Powerade with
            lemon-lime flavor quickly, had unresponsive 'back' button issues.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Interview Insights:</strong> Machine usage is very easy,
            frequent use after practice for their sport, focused mainly on
            Powerade, didn't know about the QR code feature.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Mainly uses the machine for hydration
            needs, wants quick access and options over other features.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="person 3">
          <h3>Person 3</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Observations:</strong> Took time deciding, chose Coke with
            vanilla, had issues with 'back' button.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Interview Insights:</strong> Finds the machine intuitive and
            easy, uses occasionally, appreciates the well-organized and
            informative screens, didn't know about the QR code.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Enjoys creating custom drinks leisurely,
            likes the machine's variety and ease of use but faces slight
            frustrations with screen responsiveness.

        <p>
          The goal of this Development project was to create a list of items
          similar to an online store or list maker with sorting, filtering, and
          an aggregator like a cart or favorites list.
          <br />
          <br />
          I did a competitive analysis on three companies who all had features
          that I thought about either implementing or improving on in my own
          project.
          <br />
          <br />
          I decided to create a Hike To-Do List Maker since it combines my large

          AllTrails has a helpful map and extensive filtering options, but it

          Kuhl's interface is visually appealing and user-friendly, but it

          <br />

          I decided to design an interface that prioritizes detailed hike
          information over maps, featuring a to-do list sidebar and central
          display for managing hikes with sorting, filtering, and list editing
          capabilities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="dev-process">
        <p>
          I implemented filtering and sorting on the hike cards, allowing users
          to sort by height and filter for hikes in New Hampshire rated as Hard.
          <br />
          <br />
          Adding a hike to the to-do list removes it from the main area,
          replacing the add button with a remove button, to avoid duplicates.

          Additional features include a search bar, a collapsible to-do list,
          and other responsive elements to enhance design and development
          skills.

          It was really cool to combine my love for the outdoors with technical
          design. My Hike To-Do List Maker brings together some of the features
          from AllTrails, Kuhl, and Spotify into one along with some features of
          my own.

          This project not only enhanced my development skills but also allowed
          me to look at development from a user-based design approach, which
          previously I had not done. I will continue to design software with the
          user first in the future since I found it ended with a more solid and
          meaningful final product.
